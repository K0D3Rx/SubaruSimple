                    <h3>WRX Vs STi</h3>

                    <p class="wrx-sti">With 573 horsepower between the two of them, you can't go wrong.  For under $30,000, you can drive the Subaru WRX, a turbocharged, all-wheel-drive performance car, respected the world over.  If you have approximately $8,000 more, you can buy the STi--a WRX on steroids.  For the extra money, you get a bigger engine with more power, an even more sophisticated suspension, and many other upgrades.  </p>
